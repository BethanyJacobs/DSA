<!--History of Twin Cities Section-->
<h1>History of Twin Cities</h1>
<p>These are regarded as a form of both legal and social agreement between towns and cities. This concept promotes geographical, political, cultural and commerical ties. You can have either twin towns or sister cities. The ideology of this was inspired after the Second World War. It was known to be an act of peace and reconciliation. It aided in the encouragement of trade and tourism. In the modern world, it is increasingly utilised as a strategic form of international business links between the cities and towns involved.</p>
